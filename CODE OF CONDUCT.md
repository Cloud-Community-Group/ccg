# Code of Conduct

Cloud Community Group's Code of Conduct (the "Community Code") dictates how we uphold our culture and value systems to build and preserve trust between community members, partners, and other stakeholders, while achieving our mission.

To ensure that Cloud Community Group remains a safe and respectful space for everyone, we ask that all members adhere to the following code of conduct:

## 1. Be respectful and inclusive
We welcome members with diverse backgrounds, beliefs, and perspectives, and expect everyone to treat each other with the same feeling of respect and kindness. Offensive language, derogatory comments, or any other behavior that contributes to an unwelcoming environment will not be tolerated in any way.

## 2. Be helpful, but don't overstep
The group exists to help members with cloud-related questions and problems. We encourage members to ask questions, share knowledge, and help each other out. However, we also recognize the importance of respecting boundaries. If someone asks for help, they should also know that it's possible that the person is too occupied to respond, and may decline. If that's the case, please don't badger them into responding.

## 3. Don't engage in hate speech or harassment
Our community does not tolerate hate speech or harassment of any kind. This includes, but is not limited to, bullying, threats, or discrimination based on personal characteristics.

## 4. Respect others' privacy and personal information
Please respect the privacy and personal information of your fellow community members. Sharing others' personal information without their explicit consent is strictly prohibited.

## 5. Follow the rules of the community
We ask that all members abide by the rules and guidelines set forth by the community. Failure to do so may result in removal from the community.

## 6. Be mindful of your words and actions
Please be aware that your words and actions can and will (in most cases) have an impact on others in the community. We ask that all members be mindful of how they interact with others and strive to create a positive and supportive environment for everyone.

By joining Cloud Community Group, you agree to abide by this code of conduct. If you have any questions or concerns, please reach out to a member of the community leadership team.

## Report a Concern

The most important part of having a Code of Conduct is to enforce it. We take great steps to ensure that the Community Code is being followed. However, if you notice that someone is in violation of the Code, or does something that is in violation, please report to info@cloudcommunity.group so we can take action on the same.
