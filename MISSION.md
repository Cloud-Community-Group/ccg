# Mission

## Achieve the highest standards of quality of information
One of the foremost beliefs at Cloud Community Group is that quality matters more than quantity. This belief drives us as a community. We strive to bring quality into the content we create as well as the relationships and partnerships that we forge with others.

## Promote cloud adoption
We like to promote the adoption of cloud and cloud services and helping others to understand the importance of cloud skills. We do this through organising different events and programs, sometimes in close collaboration with other communities.

## Help in fostering a positive atmosphere
We like to help in fostering a positive atmosphere by being welcoming and inclusive as much as possible.
